## -- CHANGELOG --
2024-09-08
  - started this git, cloned to local, altered this README.md, push to main. Hello World!
  - added /data/.env and .gitignore
  - tested .env ... wasn't really working well. oh well
  - added main.py, auth.py, moved /data/.env to .env ... that move made .env work. Not interested in making a .env work from /data/, keeping this the way it is
